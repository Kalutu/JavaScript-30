# JavaScript30 Challenge
Welcome to my 30-day Vanilla JavaScript coding challenge! This project is a result of my participation in the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos, where I aim to build 30 different projects using only pure Vanilla JavaScript without the use of frameworks, compilers, libraries, or boilerplate code.


## Introduction
The JavaScript30 challenge is an initiative by Wes Bos to improve JavaScript skills by building 30 projects in 30 days. The goal is to enhance understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with various aspects of the language.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for each project, along with any additional notes or reflections on the challenges faced during the process.


## Usage

To explore a specific project, navigate to the corresponding project directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file.

To run any project locally, make sure you have a modern web browser installed. Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and you should be able to interact with the project.

## Credits

Special thanks to [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) for creating the JavaScript30 challenge and providing valuable resources for improving JavaScript skills.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code for your own projects!
